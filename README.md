# SPARTA_GLOBAL_GAME_FLAPPYBIRD

My attempt to build the game Flappy Bird, using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. The game is based on a bird that is controlled using the spacebar by you to fly through obstacles. The game start page includes a list of instructions on how to play, which is the first page displayed once the game is opened.
