# SPARTA_GLOBAL_GAME_FLAPPYBIRD

This is my attempt to build the game Flappy Bird, utilising HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. This project was over the course of four days, with the task split into two sprints. GitHub and Trello were also used to help prioritise tasks and to track changes made to the project. The game ran continuously, where players avoided obstacles with points awarded for every obstacle cleared. As the game progresses, the difficulty and speed increase to provide further challenges. The game start page includes a list of instructions on how to play, which is the first page displayed once the game is opened. Being new to JavaScript, this project challenged my ability to research and apply new techniques and gave me a greater understanding of jQuery.
